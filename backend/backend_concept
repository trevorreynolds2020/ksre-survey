For the backend, you'll use AWS Lambda (or at least that's what IT recommended we use)
for the user authentication and sending information to a database. 

For authentication you'll want to use:
    - Redirect the user to https://signin.k-state.edu/WebISO/ to login
    - Create a ticket
    - Based on the response decide whether or not user is logged in


Here are two examples of handling user athentication:
    - .NET C# -> https://github.com/zombiepaladin/asp-core-cas-auth-test
    - nodeJS -> https://github.com/zombiepaladin/auth-cas

You'll have to POST the information from redux (reportData,directReportData,indirectReportData,eventData)
to the KSRE users ID in the database.
